## Overview

This repository contains the full implementation of a novel topic modeling framework
that integrates **LDA**, **BERTopic**, and a **Graph Neural Network (DMoN)**
to overcome the limitations of each standalone model.

- **LDA** captures probabilistic co-occurrence structure but lacks semantic similarity.
- **BERTopic** captures contextual coherence but lacks interpretability of topic-word relations.
- **Our method** fuses both into a keyword graph and applies DMoN clustering to extract
  structurally and semantically coherent topics.

## Methodology

The proposed pipeline consists of three stages:

### Stage 1 — Topic Model Output Extraction
- **LDA** produces a topic-word probability matrix (K words × T topics).
- **BERTopic** (via SBERT, `paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2`) produces 384-dim word embeddings.

### Stage 2 — Keyword Graph Construction
- **Strong edges**: Top-K keywords per LDA topic form dense intra-topic connections (edge weight = 1).
- **Weak edges**: Each non-core word connects to its most similar core word via cosine similarity (0 < weight < 1).

| Edge Connections | Node Feature |

### Stage 3 — DMoN-based Clustering
- Node features = SBERT word embeddings (384-dim)
- A 3-layer GCN encoder performs message passing over the keyword graph.
- DMoN's modularity loss + collapse regularization identifies structurally stable topic clusters.

## Key Results

Evaluated on 1,015 Korean news articles (Jan 2023 – Feb 2025) from [BIG KINDS](https://www.bigkinds.or.kr), preprocessed to **2,597 keywords**.

| Model | C<sub>w2v</sub> | C<sub>v</sub> | Modularity |
|---|---|---|---|
| LDA | 0.5846 | 0.4391 | 0.1910 |
| BERTopic | 0.6779 | 0.4754 | 0.2347 |
| **Ours (DMoN)** | **0.7220** | **0.5621** | **0.3454** |
| **Improvement over LDA** | **+23.5%** | **+28.0%** | **+80.8%** |
